# PowerSchool
powerschool is a Python client for the [PowerSchool SIS](https://www.powerschool.com/solutions/student-information-system/powerschool-sis) API

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install powerschool.
```bash
pip install powerschool
```

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have a valid [plugin](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/plugin-xml) installed with the proper data access provisioned for your purposes.
   
2. Instantiate a client by passing the host name of your server and one form of authentication:
   - client credentials (tuple)
   ```python
    import powerschool
    
    client_id = 'CLi3N7-Id'
    client_secret = 'cL13N7-53cR37'
    my_credentials = (client_id, client_secret)
    
    ps = powerschool.PowerSchool('my.host.name', auth=my_credentials)
    ```
   - access token (dict)
   ```python
    import powerschool
    
    with open('/path/to/token_file.json', 'r') as f:
        my_token = json.load(f)
        
    ps = powerschool.PowerSchool('my.host.name', auth=my_token)
    ```


## Usage
>*Refer to the [docs](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/data-access) for full functionality, including resources, searching, and pagination.*

**Instantiate a table or PowerQuery object:**
```python
schools_table = ps.get_schema_table('schools')

powerquery = ps.get_named_query('com.pearson.core.student.search.get_student_basic_info')
```

**Get the record count for a table:**
```python
schools_table.count()
```

**Query all records, all columns on a table:**
>*Pagination is handled automatically by the client. However, you can manually pass `pagesize` and `page` parameters, should you choose.*
```python
schools_table.query()
```

**Query all records on a table, with filter and columns list:**
```python
params = {
    'q': 'id=ge=10000',
    'projection': 'school_number,abbreviation',
}
schools_table.query(**params)
```

**Query a specific record on a table:**
```python
schools_table.query(dcid=123)
```

**Execute a PowerQuery, passing arguments in the body:**
```python
payload = {
    'studentdcid': '5432',
}
powerquery.query(body=payload)
```
